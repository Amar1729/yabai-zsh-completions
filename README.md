# zsh completions for yabai

Tab completions for the macOS tiling window manager [`yabai`](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/). Requires `jq` (json parser) be installed and on your PATH.

Can be installed like a standard zsh plugin (e.g. using a plugin manager like antibody, or add to your oh-my-zsh plugins directory).

Since this plugin is using the `src/` directory format, you may need a `path:src` specifier if using antibody.
